## Usage

Once installed, you can invite the bot to your server. Use the following command to create a temporary voice channel:

```
!createchannel [channel-name]
```

Replace `[channel-name]` with your desired channel name. The bot will create a voice channel that lasts as long as there are users in it.

### Example

```plaintext
!createchannel Game Night
```

This command creates a voice channel named "Game Night". The channel will disappear when all users leave.
